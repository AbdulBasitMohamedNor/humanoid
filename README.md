# Human Meter

Human Meter is a sleek and inspiring single page app that turns your daily good deeds into a futuristic visual journey. At its heart is a glowing silhouette that fills from the bottom up in rich emerald tones as you tick off acts of prayer, charity, kindness and learning. Youâ€™ll see your progress rise like life energy flowing through a digital avatar, accompanied by motivating messages that evolve as you improve. A dynamic checklist lets you track up to ten custom deeds per day, while a shimmering progress bar and crisp percentage indicator keep you informed at a glance. The interface adapts beautifully to phones and desktops, blending glassy panels, smooth animations and a dark gradient backdrop for a truly modern feel. With built-in history, colour blind mode, sound effects and multi-language support in English, Arabic and Swedish, Human Meter makes cultivating good habits both fun and rewarding. Experience a new way to grow spiritually and watch your efforts light up.
